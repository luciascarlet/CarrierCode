## Roadmap:
(Given my track record when it comes to finishing things, none of these will probably ever happen ðŸ™‚)
- more consistent letterforms/alignment
- ligatures
- some stylistic alternates; e.g. double-storey "g", stylised 3/6/9, sans-serif 1, misc. variations of letter shapes
- light/bold variants, variable weight
- extra condensed & wider versions, variable width
